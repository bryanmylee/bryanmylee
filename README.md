  Hi there, I'm <a href="https://bryanmylee.com">Bryan</a>! ðŸ‘‹

  A software developer with a passion for learning new things!

## Current goals

**Rust and WebAssembly**

I'm currently learning Rust and building an online Tetris Perfect Clear solver with WebAssembly.

* Building the Perfect Clear solver has been much harder than expected.

**Three.js and WebXR**

I'm improving my 3D modelling skills and learning more Three.js to build interactive 3D experiences. I also want to apply these skills into building virtual reality interfaces with WebXR.

## Projects

Check out a list of my completed projects [here. ðŸš€](https://bryanmylee.com/projects)

**Wave** - A simple and beautiful pomodoro app to keep you focused.

**meetwhen.io** - A beautiful and mobile-friendly group scheduling application.

**HelloWorld** - A mobile AR application that lets you explore the world from your home.

...and a whole bunch of [open source projects](https://bryanmylee.com/projects#open-source).
